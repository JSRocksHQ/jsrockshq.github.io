                            <p>ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) introduces two new distinct, yet closely related, concepts: <strong>iterables</strong> and <strong>iterators</strong>.<br>
Now you will truly learn how important these concepts are and how to make good use of them.
</p>
<h2 id="iterables">Iterables</h2>
<p>Iterable objects are objects that implement the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-iterable-interface">Iterable interface</a>. That is, iterable objects expose a default iteration method, allowing them to define or customize their iteration behavior.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see some examples:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">let iterable = [1, 2, 3];
for (let item of iterable) {
    console.log(item); // 1, 2, 3
}

let iterable2 = new Set([4, 5, 6]);
for (let item of iterable2) {
    console.log(item); // 4, 5, 6
}

let iterable3 = &#39;789&#39;;
for (let item of iterable3) {
    console.log(item); // &#39;7&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;9&#39;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of">for-of</a> statement accepts any iterable object, thus providing an uniform iteration syntax to completely distinct data structures by making use of the Iterable interface they implement.</p>
<h3 id="so-what-exactly-is-this-iterable-interface-you-speak-of-">So what exactly is this Iterable interface you speak of?</h3>
<p>Any object that contains a <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method is an iterable object.<br>
In case you are unfamiliar with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol">symbols</a>, they are objects that can be used as property keys.<br>
<code>Symbol.iterator</code> is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol#Well-known_symbols"><em>well-known</em></a> (baked in the language) Symbol, whose primary usage is defining and consuming iterable objects.</p>
<p>In the previous examples, we were implicitly making use of the <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method inherited from the given objects&#39; prototypes. Several built-ins such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array">Array</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set">Set</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String">String</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map">Map</a> define a default iteration behavior, while others such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object">Object</a> do not.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the Iterable interface allows defining and customizing objects&#39; iteration order. For a quick example, we can borrow arrays&#39; default iteration behavior (<code>Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator]</code>) to make array-like objects iterable:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">let iterable = {
    0: &#39;a&#39;,
    1: &#39;b&#39;,
    2: &#39;c&#39;,
    length: 3,
    [Symbol.iterator]: Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator]
};
for (let item of iterable) {
    console.log(item); // &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now you may be wondering: <strong>&quot;How do I implement custom iteration behavior?&quot;</strong><br>
As you already know, adding a <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method to a given object makes it iterable, but here is the catch: the <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method must return an <em>iterator object</em>, which is actually responsible for the iteration logic. We will cover this in the next section.</p>
<p>Before we move on to iterators, let&#39;s recap what the Iterable interface is about:</p>
<ul>
<li>It signals that a given object is iterable to consumers (iterable object: &quot;Hey! I have a <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method.&quot;);</li>
<li>It provides a standardized way to iterate any iterable object (iterable object: &quot;Call my <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method if you want an iterator that implements my default iteration logic&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<p>The points above may seem slightly redundant if you are familiar with interfaces (Java, C#), but it is worth being clear as this is a new addition to the JavaScript language.</p>
<p>Note that several built-in functions and language constructs that expect a sequence of values accept iterable objects. For instance, <code>Promise.all()</code> accepts any iterable object as argument, not just plain arrays. The same holds true for destructuring assignments (<code>[a, b] = iterable</code>) and <code>yield* iterable</code>.</p>
<h2 id="iterators">Iterators</h2>
<p>Iterator objects are objects that implement the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-iterator-interface">Iterator interface</a>. That is, iterator objects must have a <code>next</code> method that returns a result object in the <code>{ value: Any, done: Boolean }</code> format. The first call to the <code>next</code> method returns the result of the first iteration (e.g. the item at 0th index in an array). The <code>done</code> property signals when the iterator has been exhausted and no more values are available.</p>
<p>Here is some code to illustrate iterators:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">let iterable = [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;];

// Explicit &quot;low-level&quot; iterator consumption:
let iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();
iterator.next(); // { value: &#39;a&#39;, done: false }
iterator.next(); // { value: &#39;b&#39;, done: false }
iterator.next(); // { value: &#39;c&#39;, done: false }
iterator.next(); // { value: undefined, done: true }

// for-of abstracts away iterator instantiation and consumption:
for (let item of iterable) {
    console.log(item); // &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;
}

// A crude illustration of for-of&#39;s inner workings:
for (let _iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator](), _result, item; _result = _iterator.next(), item = _result.value, !_result.done;) {
    console.log(item); // &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have understanding of iterables and iterators, we can create our own iterable objects and customize their default iteration behavior. Let&#39;s implement the iteration behavior for an array-like object from the ground up:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">let iterable = {
    0: &#39;a&#39;,
    1: &#39;b&#39;,
    2: &#39;c&#39;,
    length: 3,
    [Symbol.iterator]() {
        let index = 0;
        return {
            next: () =&gt; {
                let value = this[index];
                let done = index &gt;= this.length;
                index++;
                return { value, done };
            }
        };
    }
};
for (let item of iterable) {
    console.log(item); // &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;
}
</code></pre>
<p>I know, at first this may look very complex and messy, but don&#39;t panic. Let&#39;s walk through it.</p>
<p>We start by creating a plain object using the object literal syntax. It contains a <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method, defined using a combination of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#Computed_property_names">computed properties</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Method_definitions">shorthand methods</a> ES2015 object literal extensions. This object has a <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method, thus it is considered an iterable object.</p>
<p>The <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method implements the default iteration logic for the object, that is, it returns an iterator object and holds the state of the given iterator. The object returned by the <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method contains a <code>next</code> method, therefore it is considered an iterator object.</p>
<p>The iterator&#39;s <code>next</code> method is implemented using an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions">arrow function</a>, so the <code>this</code> inside of it references the same object as the <code>this</code> used for the <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method invocation (i.e. the iterable data source).</p>
<p>The return value of the iterator&#39;s <code>next</code> method contains the <code>value</code> of the iteration and whether the iterator is <code>done</code> (exhausted). The example above defines those using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#Property_definitions">shorthand properties</a> syntax, by the way.</p>
<p>From here, you should be able to figure out how everything ties together. The <code>for-of</code> will call the <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method on the iterable passed in and iterate over the returned iterator, by calling its <code>next</code> method on every iteration and passing the result&#39;s <code>value</code> property to the loop body until the <code>next</code> method&#39;s result&#39;s <code>done</code> property is <code>true</code>.</p>
<h3 id="is-all-this-complexity-necessary-">Is all this complexity necessary?</h3>
<p>In short, yes. I&#39;ll address the most common doubts and misconceptions in QA format below.</p>
<h4 id="q-why-is-symbol-iterator-a-method-that-returns-an-iterator-couldn-t-it-be-an-iterator-">Q. Why is <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> a method that returns an iterator? Couldn&#39;t it be an iterator?</h4>
<p>It is a method that returns an iterator because you may want to iterate over the same data source multiple times, even concurrently:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">let iterable = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let iterator1 = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();
let iterator2 = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();

iterator1.next(); // { value: 1, done: false }

iterator2.next(); // { value: 1, done: false }
iterator2.next(); // { value: 2, done: false }
iterator2.next(); // { value: 3, done: false }

iterator1.next(); // { value: 2, done: false }
</code></pre>
<p>This is a very contrived example, but in practice it is not uncommon to iterate over the same data source concurrently, applying asynchronous processing to each value between iterations. <a href="http://koajs.com/">Koa</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tj/co">co</a> are good examples of this, although they use generators which return iterators by being called directly (instead of having a <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method).</p>
<h4 id="q-why-iterators-next-method-returns-a-data-structure-couldn-t-it-return-just-the-value-">Q. Why iterators&#39; <code>next</code> method returns a data structure? Couldn&#39;t it return just the value?</h4>
<p>In the initial iterators design, the <code>next</code> method indeed did only return the value. But then, how would you know when the iterator has been exhausted? It was nothing pretty: the <code>next</code> method would have to throw an error to signal completion. That means all calls to <code>next</code> would have to be wrapped in a <code>try/catch</code> block, which was plainly terrible.</p>
<p>In order to avoid littering iterator consumption code with <code>try/catch</code> everywhere, as well as to avoid a bizarre iterator completion signaling mechanism, we settled with the <code>next</code> method returning an object with <code>value</code> and <code>done</code> properties.</p>
<h4 id="q-why-does-it-seem-that-the-last-iterator-result-value-is-ignored-">Q. Why does it seem that the last iterator result value is ignored?</h4>
<p>When the <code>next</code> method&#39;s result has the <code>done</code> property set to <code>true</code>, it means the iterator has been exhausted and can not provide an iteration value. An iterator implementation may set a <code>value</code> property alongside <code>done: true</code> in the iterator result object, but this <code>value</code> then has special meaning: it is treated as a <em>completion</em> value, not an iteration value, and as such is ignored by built-ins that consume iterables such as <code>for-of</code>, <code>Array.from</code>, destructuring and <code>yield*</code>.</p>
<p>Iterators spawned from generators are a clear example of this. The generator&#39;s return value is set as the completion <code>value</code> of the iterator result alongside <code>done: true</code>. This completion value is ignored by iterable-consuming built-ins, which only iterate over iteration values (provided via <code>yield</code> inside generators).</p>
<h4 id="q-can-an-iterator-implementation-s-next-method-take-arguments-">Q. Can an iterator implementation&#39;s <code>next</code> method take arguments?</h4>
<p>Yes, it can! A prime example of this is passing values to inside generators, but we can make use of this in a vanilla iterator implementation as well:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">let echoIterator = {
    next(value) {
        return { value, done: false };
    }
};

echoIterator.next(42); // { value: 42, done: false }
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, there&#39;s nothing really special about iterators. But be aware that, so far, there is no way to pass arguments to the <code>next</code> method of an iterator implicitly spawned by iterable-consuming built-ins. That is, <code>for-of</code>, <code>Array.from</code> and such do not provide a way to pass arguments to the <code>next</code> method.</p>
<h4 id="q-are-infinite-iterators-valid-">Q. Are infinite iterators valid?</h4>
<p>Yes, you can manually advance them by explicitly calling their <code>next</code> method when appropriate. However, you will get an infinite loop if you try to exhaust them, obviously.</p>
<h3 id="optional-iterator-methods">Optional iterator methods</h3>
<p>Iterators may also implement optional <code>return</code> and <code>throw</code> methods, which are designed for more advanced use cases.</p>
<p>The <code>return</code> method can be used to dispose of resources that the iterator may be holding when closed early. For instance, if the body of the <code>for-of</code> reaches a <code>break</code> or <code>return</code> statement or throws an uncaught error, the <code>for-of</code> would implicitly call the iterator&#39;s <code>return</code> method (if it has such method).<br>
Note that my crude <code>for-of</code> reimplementation earlier in this post is incomplete and only illustrates the basic iteration functionality, you can see the <a href="http://babeljs.io/repl/#?experimental=false&amp;evaluate=true&amp;loose=false&amp;spec=false&amp;playground=true&amp;code=let%20iterable%20%3D%20%5B&#39;a&#39;%2C%20&#39;b&#39;%2C%20&#39;c&#39;%5D%3B%0D%0Afor%20%28let%20item%20of%20iterable%29%20%7B%0D%0A%09console.log%28item%29%3B%20%2F%2F%20&#39;a&#39;%2C%20&#39;b&#39;%2C%20&#39;c&#39;%0D%0A%7D%0D%0A&amp;runtime=true">complexity of a precise for-of reimplementation on Babel</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>throw</code> method can be used to notify the iterator of an error condition.</p>
<h2 id="iterable-iterators">Iterable iterators</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s do a quick recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Iterable interface requires the implementation of a <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method;</li>
<li>The Iterator interface requires the implementation of a <code>next</code> method.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have noticed that nothing prevents an object from implementing both Iterable and Iterator interfaces. That&#39;s what I call Iterable iterators (you may prefer Iterable Iterator objects, but I find that too verbose).</p>
<p>In fact, most iterators implement the Iterable interface. That is, most of them have a <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method, but note that iterators&#39; <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method usually returns the iterator itself instead of a new iterator:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">let iterable = [1, 2];
let iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();
iterator[Symbol.iterator]() === iterator; // true
</code></pre>
<p>It is trivial to make an Iterable iterator:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">let iterableIterator = {
    next() {/*...*/},
    [Symbol.iterator]() {
        return this;
    }
};
</code></pre>
<p>And now you may ask, <strong>&quot;How is this useful?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Well, first consider that <strong>a single data source may have multiple iteration behaviors.</strong><br>
Then, consider that iterables can only expose a single default iteration behavior.<br>
Finally, remember that <code>for-of</code> and other iterable consumers take an iterable object and implicitly call its default iteration behavior (the <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method) to get an iterator.</p>
<p>Telling an iterable consumer (e.g. <code>for-of</code>) to use a non-default iterator (an iterator other than the one returned by the <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method) for a given data source seems like a complex problem at first, right? Well, if you do the math correctly, Iterable iterators are the solution.</p>
<p>By adding a <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method to an iterator that simply returns the iterator itself, you are able to pass the iterator directly to an iterable consumer. When the consumer calls the <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method, the iterator itself will be returned and the consumer will iterate over it. Simpler than it seems, right?</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">let arr = [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;];
let keysIterator = arr.keys(); // an alternative iterator for the data source
keysIterator[Symbol.iterator]() === keysIterator; // `keysIterator` is an Iterable iterator

// The for-of will implicitly call `keysIterator[Symbol.iterator]()` and get back the `keysIterator`,
// and then iterate over it.
for (let key of keysIterator) {
    console.log(key); // 0, 1 (the array indexes)
}

// Another example using the entries iterator, which returns `[key, value]` iteration values.
// We can destructure the entries iterator&#39;s iteration values for commodity.
for (let [key, value] of arr.entries()) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${value}`); // &#39;0: a&#39;, &#39;1: b&#39;
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="trivia">Trivia</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>You&#39;ve seen the <code>Array.prototype.keys</code> and <code>Array.prototype.entries</code> methods which return iterators, so you may wondering whether there is an <code>Array.prototype.values</code> method. The ECMAScript 2015 spec. does define an <code>Array.prototype.values</code> method, but browsers are wary of shipping it to the open Web due to potential breakage (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=409858">[1]</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=875433#c8">[2]</a>). Either way, <code>Array.prototype.values</code> would simply be a reference to <code>Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator]</code>, both would point to the same method so <code>Array.prototype.values</code> is not very important at all.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is possible to pass a partially consumed Iterable iterator to an iterable consumer to have it finish exhausting it:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">let iterator = [1, 2, 3, 4][Symbol.iterator]();
iterator.next();
iterator.next();
for (let item of iterator) {
  console.log(item); // 3, 4
}
</code></pre>
<p>This happens because the Iterable iterator&#39;s <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method returns itself instead of a new iterator, as previously mentioned.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rounding-it-up">Rounding it up</h2>
<p>Woah! You&#39;ve managed to make it this far, congratulations! Now, hopefully you have a better understanding of iterables and iterators.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s do a quick recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Iterable interface provides a standardized way to iterate any iterable object (a <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> method that returns an iterator);</li>
<li>The Iterator interface allows objects to implement custom iteration logic (a <code>next</code> method that returns a <code>{ value, done }</code> object, and optional <code>return</code> and <code>throw</code> methods);</li>
<li>Any object can implement the Iterable and/or Iterator interfaces;</li>
<li>Iterators often implement the Iterable interface, which enables them to be fed to iterable consumers;</li>
<li>The iterator completion <code>value</code> (when <code>done: true</code>) is usually ignored by iterable consumers;</li>
<li>Several built-ins that you usually feed arrays to actually accept any iterable object (<code>for-of</code>, <code>Array.from</code>, <code>yield*</code>, <code>[a, b, ...rest] = iterable</code>);</li>
<li>If you maintain an API that accepts arrays as argument, please consider supporting iterables: it is as simple as calling <code>Array.from(arg)</code> to turn any iterable argument into a true array.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I guess that&#39;s finally it. We reached the end of the line. You may be wondering what you will do with your life now, but I&#39;m not sure whether I can answer this question. Perhaps you want to read about <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-generatorfunction-objects">Generators</a> now? :)</p>
